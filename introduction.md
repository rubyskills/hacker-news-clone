# Introduction

Rails was awesome sauce. We all loved it and thank DHH and the core contributors for delivering us a framework that reduced development headache and increased productivity. It also boosted my web development career in more ways than I can count. As time went on and Rails entered the mainstream, the framework started to get bloated. Our honeymoon was over and I was starting to look elsewhere. 

## The Hot Web DSL

Sinatra, a tiny web framework, completely changed the way I thought about the core design principals in Rails. Sure, a lot of the higher level concepts were the same, but the implementation was much simpler and thus alluring. Instead of bulky controllers and a "manifest" for my routes, I had a tiny DSL for routing requests. The idea was great but when requirements started getting more elaborate, the application structure would start to break down and suddenly you find yourself begging for Rails conventions again. I started re-inventing the wheel with my Sinatra applications and created my own conventions. Clearly Sinatra wasn't meant for my enterprise applications and back to Rails I went.

## Padrino

Coming Soon.

## Objectives

The book will highlight the differences between Rails and Padrino and my hope is that you will consider it for your next large scale web project in Ruby. Hopefully you'll see the light and help make the Padrino community a brighter place. Just be sure to leave your bloated code in your own private github repositories.
